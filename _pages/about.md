I am a researcher at the NLP Department in [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi, advised by <br>[Dr. Alham Fikri Aji](https://afaji.github.io/). Currently, I'm working Parameter-Efficient Learning, Multilinguality, and Multiculturalism of language models. Recently, I worked with [Prof. Monojit Choudhury](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WR1ImCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) to systematically [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15412) the current Cultural research in Large Language Models (LLMs). 

In 2023, I graduated as a cum laude and the youngest graduate with a [Master's in Intelligent Systems](https://stei.itb.ac.id/program-pasca-sarjana/magister-informatika/) from Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia. I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Ayu Purwarianti](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/ayu-purwarianti), [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentawinata.com/), and [Samuel Cahyawijaya](https://samuelcahyawijaya.github.io/) on a project involving [unseen languages generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06034v2). In 2021, I graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung with a B.S in Computer Science. My [undergraduate thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12405) on studying language models' code-mixing robustness in Indonesian local languages got published in the SUMEval Workshop in AACL 2022, covered by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/bloombergs-ai-engineering-group-publishes-4-nlp-research-papers-at-aacl-ijcnlp-2022/).
